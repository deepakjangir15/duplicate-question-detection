This repository has 5 python notebook files present. 

1. The two notebook named 'Initial_EDA_QuoraDataset' and 'Initial_EDA_StackOverflow' which were used initially used for spiking and exploring the Quora and Stack Overflow dataset. 

2. The notebook named 'Integration_using_Machine_Learning_Algorithms' was used to merge both the quora and stack overflow dataset. Preprocessing, feature engineering and all the models training were done in this notebook. The models trained were RandomForest, XGBoost, Decision Tree.

3. The notebook named 'Integration_using_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_LSTM_with_Glove_and_Word2Vec_Embedding' was used to implement the two LSTM architectures using Glove and word2vec embedding. 

4. The final notebook named 'Dissertation_UI' was used to implement the UI using streamlit.
